# HIGH SCHOOL ARDUINO PROJECTS

Welcome to a collection of my high school Arduino projects.

Explore each project's README for details, features, and insights into these remarkable Arduino-based endeavors.

### Crossing Lights Simulator using LEDs

This code simulates a pedestrian crossing by controlling LEDs to display traffic lights. It's a great way to understand the principles of traffic control systems.

#### Key Features
- **LED Control:** This code effectively manages multiple LEDs to mimic traffic lights, creating a realistic pedestrian crossing simulation.
- **Traffic Sequence:** The program follows a predefined traffic light sequence, allowing you to visualize the change of lights as they do at a real crossing.
- **Learning Tool:** This project is an excellent educational tool for anyone interested in learning about traffic light control logic and Arduino programming.

### Zoetrope

This code controls a motor which one would place a rotating drum on to produce animation.

### Maze Pathfinding Robot

This code powers a robot capable of autonomously navigating through a maze, making decisions based on sensors.

#### Key Features
- **Autonomous Navigation:** The code equips the robot with sensors to detect obstacles and choose the best path to navigate through a maze.
- **Pathfinding Algorithm:** The algorithm implemented is based on measuring distances, and adjusting the robots movement based on the confined spaces it finds itself in.
- **Problem-Solving:** Use this code to explore the world of robotics and problem-solving as your robot cleverly maneuvers through intricate mazes.

### Ultrasonic Robot

This code powers a robot to measure distances in front of it, display the results on a seven-segment display, and tank turn based on the longer distance.

#### Key Features
- **Distance Sensing:** The code utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to measure distances and provides accurate readings.
- **Seven-Segment Display:** The results are prominently displayed on a seven-segment display, making it easy to read.
- **Versatile Applications:** You can adapt this code for various distance measurement applications, from obstacle detection to interactive displays.

Feel free to explore these Arduino projects and have fun!
